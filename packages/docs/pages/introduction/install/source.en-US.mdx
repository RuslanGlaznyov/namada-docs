# Install from source

<Callout type="warning">
Please note that, although installing from source is the recommended route for installing namada, it can prove to be difficult, and is not recommended for beginners. For a first time installation, the installation process can take up to an hour. Building binaries from source can also take a long time, depending on your machine.
</Callout>

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have the correct [pre-requisites](./source/pre-requisites.mdx) downloaded and installed.

## Installing Namada
Now that you have all the required dependencies installed, you can clone the source code from the [Namada repository](https://github.com/anoma/namada) and build it with:

```shell copy
git clone https://github.com/anoma/namada.git
cd namada 
make install
```

<Callout type="warning">
During internal and private testnets, checkout the latest testnet branch using `git checkout $NAMADA_TESTNET_BRANCH`.
Where `$NAMADA_TESTNET_BRANCH` is the name of the testnet branch, which will be specified in the [testnet documentation](../testnets/environment-setup.mdx).
</Callout>

## Adding binaries to `$PATH`
The binaries should be added to `$PATH` from the `make install` command. 
However, if this for some reason did not work, a solution may be to copy the binaries 
from `namada/target/release` to `$HOME/.local/bin/` for example: 

```shell copy 
cp namada/target/release/namada* $HOME/.local/bin/
```

## Using the binaries
See the page on [using namada binaries](./binaries/overview-of-binaries.mdx) for more information.

## Troubleshooting
Please see the troubleshooting page for [building from source](./source/troubleshooting.mdx) for more information.
