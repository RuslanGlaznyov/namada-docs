# Using the binaries

Once installed, you should have the following binaries:

| Binary | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `namada` | The main binary that can be used to interact with all the components of Namada |
| `namadan` | The ledger node |
| `namadac` | The client |
| `namadaw` | The wallet |
| `namadar` | The ethereum bridge relayer |

The main binary `namada` has sub-commands for all of the other binaries. Therefore, the following commands are equivalent:

| `namada` command | `namada`x equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| `namada client` | `namadac` |
| `namada node` | `namadan` |
| `namada wallet` | `namadaw` |
| `namada relayer` | `namadar` |


To explore the command-line interface, the `--help` argument can be added at any sub-command level to find out any possible sub-commands and/or arguments.
