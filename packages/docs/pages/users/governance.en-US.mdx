# Governance

The Namada governance mechanism gives users the possibility to upgrade the protocol dynamically.

There are two different mechanism to create a proposal:

- [On-chain proposals](./governance/on-chain-governance.mdx): Proposal is voted on and tallied on-chain. This can optionally include proposal code to be executed if the proposal is accepted.
- [Off-chain proposals](./governance/off-chain-governance.mdx)
