# Transferring assets over IBC

It is possible to make ibc transfers using the Namada cli with the command `namadac ibc-transfer`. The assumed pre-requisites are that a channel has been created and Hermes is running with the proper config on two nodes.

In order to conduct an IBC transfer using Namada's `ibc-transfer` command, we will need to know the `base-dir` and `node` of each instance (and other transfer parameters).
`base-dir` is the base directory of each node, see [base-dir](../operators/ledger/base-directory.mdx) for more information.
`node` is the `rpc_addr` of the relayer.
You can run
```shell
grep "rpc_addr" ${HERMES_CONFIG}
```
to find the address.

<Callout>
 **For the local node ONLY**

 To find your ledger address for Chain A, you can run the following command
 ```bash copy
 export BASE_DIR_A = "${HERMES}/data/namada-a/.namada"
 export LEDGER_ADDRESS_A = "$(grep "rpc_address" ${BASE_DIR_A}/${CHAIN_A_ID}/setup/validator-0/.namada/${CHAIN_A_ID}/config.toml)"
 ```
</Callout>

The channel ID for this chain will depend on the order in which one created the channel. Since we have only opened one channel, the `channel-id` is `channel-0`, but as more are created, these increase by index incremented by 1. The channel-id should be communicated by the relayer.

Assuming that the open channel is `channel-0`, you can save it in an environment variable by running
```bash copy
export CHANNEL_ID = "channel-0"
```

The inter-blockchain transfers from Chain A can be achieved by
```bash copy
namadac --base-dir ${BASE_DIR_A}
    ibc-transfer \
        --amount ${AMOUNT} \
        --source ${SOURCE_ALIAS} \
        --receiver ${RECEIVER_RAW_ADDRESS} \
        --token ${TOKEN_ALIAS} \
        --channel-id ${CHANNEL_ID} \
        --node ${LEDGER_ADDRESS_A}
```
Where the above variables in `${VARIABLE}` must be substituted with appropriate values. The raw address of the receiver can be found by `namadaw --base-dir ${BASE_DIR_B} address find --alias ${RECEIVER}`.

E.g.
```bash copy
namadac --base-dir ${BASE_DIR_A}
    ibc-transfer \
    --amount 100 \
    --source albert \
    --receiver atest1d9khqw36g56nqwpkgezrvvejg3p5xv2z8y6nydehxprygvp5g4znj3phxfpyv3pcgcunws2x0wwa76 \
    --token nam \
    --channel-id channel-0 \
    --node 127.0.0.1:27657
```

Once the transaction has been submitted, a relayer will need to relay the packet to the other chain. This is done automatically by the relayer running Hermes. If the packet is never succsesfully relayed, the funds are returned to the sender after a timeout. See more infomation in the [specs](https://specs.namada.net/interoperability/ibc).

## Transferring assets back from Cosmos-SDK based chains

When a transfer has been made to a Cosmos-SDK based chain, the ibc transfer is conducted as above. However, when transferring back from the cosmos-based chain, clearly the `namadac ibc-transfer` command will not work. Instead, you want to use [`gaiad`](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia).

```bash
gaiad tx ibc-transfer transfer transfer ${CHANNEL_ID} ${RECEIVER_RAW_ADDRESS} ${AMOUNT}${IBC_TOKEN_ADDRESS} --from ${COSMOS_ALIAS} --node ${COSMOS_RPC_ENDPOINT} --fees 5000uatom
```

for example:

```bash copy
gaiad tx ibc-transfer transfer transfer channel-0 atest1d9khqw368qcyx3jxxu6njs2yxs6y2sjyxdzy2d338pp5yd35g9zrv334gceng3z9gvmryv2pfdddt4 10ibc/281545A262215A2D7041CE1B518DD4754EC7097A1C937BE9D9AB6F1F11B452DD --from my-cosmos-address --node https://rpc.sentry-01.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz:443 --fees 5000uatom
```
