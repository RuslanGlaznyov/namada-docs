# Shielded Rewards

Shielded rewards are distributed to all users in the shielded set. Users are rewared `NAM` tokens for each epoch their incentivised assets are in the shielded set. Informally, the amount of `NAM` rewarded for a specific asset is proportional to the amount of that asset in the shielded pool. Each asset has a "reward rate" specified by governance, which sets the constant of proportionality for that asset. 

The interested reader should consult [the specs](https://specs.namada.net/economics/proof-of-stake) for a more precise explanation of how the reward is calculated.
