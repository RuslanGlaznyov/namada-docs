# Multisignature accounts on Namada

Multisignature accounts (multisigs) are accounts on Namada that allow for multiple signers. There are many benefits of having multisigs, including but not limited to 

- Increased security
- Ability to share wallets
- Better recovery options

For this reason, all accounts on Namada are multisignature accounts by default.

## Initialising a multisignature account

Before creating an account, a user must generate at least one cryptographic `key`, that will be used to sign transactions.

The following method will generate such a key:
```shell
namadaw key gen \
--alias my-key1
```
A second key can be generated as well (which will be useful for multisigs):
```shell
namadaw key gen \
--alias my-key2
```

An implicit address can also be generated:
```shell
namadaw address gen \
--alias my-address
```

Accounts on Namada are initialised through the following method:

**Non-multisig account (single signer)**
```shell
namadac init-account \
--alias my-multisig-alias \
--public-keys my-key1 \
--signing-keys my-key1
```

**Multisig account (at leat 2 signers)**
```shell
namadac init-account \
--alias my-multisig-alias \
--public-keys my-key1,my-key2 \
--signing-keys my-key1,my-key2 \
--threshold 2
```


## Submitting a multisignature transaction
In order to submit a multisignature transaction, an offline transaction must first be constructed. 

### Constructing an offline transaction
<Callout type="warning">
For `v0.23.0` there are certain limitations to the offline transaction construction. Please be weary of any bugs that may arise.
</Callout>

The `--dump-tx` argument allows a user to do this. A folder is required to be specified where the transaction will be dumped.

```shell
mkdir tx_dumps
```

This can be done through the following method:
```shell
namadac transfer \
--source my-multisig-alias \
--target some-established-account-alias \
--token NAM \
--amount 100 \
--signing-keys my-key1 \
--dump-tx \
--output-folder-path tx_dumps
```

What this means is that the transaction has been constructed, and is ready to be signed. 

Within the specified folder, a `.tx` file will be created. This file contains the hexadecimal representation of the transaction bytes. This file can be used to sign the transaction.

### Signing the transaction

The next step is to sign the transaction. `my-key1` can sign the transaction through the following method:
```shell
namadac sign-tx \
--tx-path "<path-to-file>" \
--signing-keys my-key1 \
--owner my-multisig-alias
```

<Callout type="info">
Note that any number of `--signing-keys` could sign the transaction in this stage. This will produce multiple signatures, which can be used to submit the transaction.
</Callout>


Which means that the signature has been saved to this file (located in the current directory). 

Let's save this as an alias:
```shell
export SIGNATURE_ONE="offline_signature_FB7246E3FC43F59D8AEEC234EBFDB9DF1AC9BB7B14E536D05A7E2617CA41D4CD_0.tx"
```

Ensure to sign the transaction with at least k-of-n keys, where k is the minimum number of signatures required to submit a transaction, and n is the total number of keys. In this example, k=2 and n=2.

Then let's say this signing produces another signature which we save to the alias `SIGNATURE_TWO`.

### Submitting the transaction

The final step is to submit the transaction. This can be done through the following method:
```shell
namadac tx \
--tx-path "tx_dumps/a45ef98a817290d6fc0efbd480bf66647ea8061aee1628ce09b4af4f4eeed1c2.tx" \
--signatures $SIGNATURE_ONE \
--signatures $SIGNATURE_TWO \
--owner my-multisig-alias \
--gas-payer my-key1
```

<Callout type="info">
Note the lack of commas used in the `--signatures` argument. This is because the argument is a list of files, not a list of signatures.
Also note the `tx_dumps` folder. This is the folder where the transaction was dumped to as specified in `--output-folder-path` in the previous step.
</Callout>

## Changing the multisig threshold
It is possible to change the multisig threshold of an account. This can be done through the following method:
```shell
namadac update-account \
--address my-multisig-address \
--threshold 1 \
--signing-keys my-key1,my-key2
```

One can check that the threshold has been updated correctly by running:
```shell
namadac query-account \
--owner my-multisig-address
```
Which will yield the threshold of 1, together with the two public keys.

## Changing the public keys of a multisig account
It is possible to change the public keys of a multisig account. This can be done through the following method:
```shell
namadac update-account \
--address my-multisig-address \
--public-keys my-key3,my-key4,my-key5 \
--signing-keys my-key1,my-key2
```

Which will change the public keys of the multisig account from `my-key1` and `my-key2` to the keys `my-key3`, `my-key4` and `my-key5` (assuming they exist in the wallet).

The public-keys provided to the argument `--public-keys` will become the new signers of the multisig. The list must be a list of public keys, separated by commas, and without spaces. There must be at least 1 public key in the list, and the length of list must be at least the threshold of the multisig account.
