# Send and Receive NAM tokens

In Namada, tokens are implemented as accounts with the [Token Validity Predicate](https://github.com/anoma/namada/blob/9b67281e359ebff5467cad57c866fbcf91eb80c8/shared/src/ledger/native_vp/multitoken.rs#L30).
The validity predicate (VP) checks, in particular, that the total supply (of the token) is preserved in any transaction that uses this token. Your wallet will be pre-loaded with some token addresses that are initialized in the genesis block.

### Initialize an established account

If you already have a key in your wallet, you can skip this step. Otherwise, [generate a new keypair](../transparent-accounts.mdx#generate-a-keypair) now.

Then, send a transaction to initialize your new established account and save its address with the alias `establishment`. The `keysha` public key will be written into the account's storage for authorizing future transactions. We also sign this transaction with `keysha`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ¤¡">
Note the use  of the placeholder `keysha` for the key parameter. This is a completely configurable parameter, and should just refer to the alias of the key signing the transaction (that has a positive nam balance).
</Callout>

```shell copy
namada client init-account \
  --alias establishment \
  --public-keys keysha \
  --signing-keys keysha \
  --threshold 1
```

Once this transaction has been applied, the client will automatically see the new address created by the transaction and add it to your wallet with the chosen alias `establishment`.

This command uses the prebuilt [User Validity Predicate](https://github.com/anoma/namada/blob/main/wasm/wasm_source/src/vp_user.rs).

### Send a Payment

To submit a regular token transfer from your account to the `validator-1` address:

```shell copy
namada client transfer \
  --source establishment \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --signing-keys keysha
```

This command will attempt to find and use the key of the source address to sign the transaction.

### See your balance

To query token balances for a specific token and/or owner:

```shell copy
namada client balance --token NAM --owner my-new-acc
```

<Callout type="info">
For any client command that submits a transaction (`init-account`, `transfer`, `tx`, `update` and [PoS transactions](../../operators/validators/proof-of-stake.mdx)), 
you can use the `--dry-run-wrapper` flag to simulate the transaction being applied in the block and see what would be the result.
</Callout>

### See every known addresses' balance

You can see the token's addresses known by the client when you query all tokens balances:

```shell copy
namada client balance
```
