## About Namada

[Namada](https://namada.net/) is a privacy-for-assets centric blockchain using zero-knowledge proof technology.
Namada's cryptographical features give users asset-agnostic, interchain privacy, and is being built by the Anoma foundation.

### Key innovations:

- Zcash-like transfers for any assets (fungible and non-fungible)
- Rewarded usage of privacy as a public good
- Interoperability with Ethereum via a custom bridge with trust-minimization
