# Namada Indexer

In collaboration with [Zondax](https://zondax.ch/), an indexer for the Namada blockchain has been born.

The Namada indexer (a.k.a `namadexer`) constantly queries the Namada blockchain, and together with the [SDK](./sdk.mdx), is able to map blocks, transactions, along with other valuable information into a relational database (postgres).

This is especially useful for performing analytics over the blockchain, including storing historical data in a way that could be easily queried.

## Setting up

The namada indexer's source code can be found [here](https://github.com/zondax/namadexer) and is simple to set up.

The `namadexer` works best together with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zondax/namadexer.git
cd namadexer
make compose
```

## Running the server and db
Once the DockerFile has run, it is straightforward to both set up the postgres database as well as the server that will query the database.

Make sure that `postgres` [is installed](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) on the local machine.

**Run postgres in docker**
```bash
make postgres 
# or run (and change arguments, e.g port):
# docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=wow -e POSTGRES_DB=blockchain -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```
Once the postgres server is up and running, it is time to set up the server that will query the postgres db.

Execute the following command in order to set up the server
```
make run_server
```

If successful, the server should be running as a daemon on the localhost at port `30303`.

## Run the indexer

First, ensure that the `Settings.toml` within `config/Settings.toml` is configured correctly.

<Expandable>
```toml
log_level = "info"
network = "public-testnet-14"

[database]
host = "0.0.0.0:5435"
user = "postgres"
password = "wow"
dbname = "blockchain"
# Optional field to configure a timeout if database connection 
# fails.
connection_timeout = 20


[server]
serve_at = "0.0.0.0"
port = 30303

[indexer]
tendermint_addr = "0.0.0.0"
port = 26657

[jaeger]
enable = false
host = "localhost"
port = 6831

[prometheus]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 9000
```

**Interpreting the toml**

It is important to change the following parameters:

1. `indexer.tendermint_addr` - This should be the address and corresponding port of a synced Namada full node

2. `database.host` - This should be the tcp address (with port) where the postgres database is running.
</Callout>

Once the setup is complete, it is possible to start the indexer

```bash
make run_indexer
```

## Querying the database

The pre-defined endpoints to query the database are described in the documentation [here](https://github.com/Zondax/namadexer/blob/main/docs/04-server.md).
