# Genesis validator setup

A genesis validator is one which is a validator right from the first block of the chain, i.e., at genesis. The details of genesis validators are hardcoded into the genesis file that is distributed to all users who want to interact with a chain.

### Prerequisites

- a machine that meets the [requirements](../hardware.mdx) for running a validator node
- an associated public IPv4 address with ports 26656 reachable from anywhere for P2P connections

## Pre-genesis 

To setup all the [required keys](#required-keys) for a genesis validator for an upcoming network, you can execute the following command with an alias of your choice. Note that this alias is public (the address of your validator account will be visible in every wallet) and must be unique within the network.

You must also provide a static `{IP:port}` to the `--net-address` argument of your future node's P2P address.

### 1. Create your validator keys:

####  Before `v0.25.0`

``` bash
export VALIDATOR_ALIAS="CHOOSE_A_NAME_FOR_YOUR_VALIDATOR"
export PUBLIC_IP="LAPTOP_OR_SERVER_IP"
namada client utils init-genesis-validator \
    --alias $VALIDATOR_ALIAS \
    --max-commission-rate-change 0.01 \
    --commission-rate 0.05 \
    --net-address $PUBLIC_IP:26656
```

#### After `v0.25.0`

##### 1.1 Generate your keys

``` bash
export KEY_ALIAS="CHOOSE_A_NAME_FOR_YOUR_VALIDATOR-KEY"
namadaw key gen --pre-genesis --alias $ALIAS
```
##### 1.2 Generate your validator

<Callout type="info">
Before pre-genesis validator tomls are collected, the public keys must first be collected, and balances given to each key. This is done by the network organizer.
</Callout>

``` bash
export VALIDATOR_ALIAS="CHOOSE_A_NAME_FOR_YOUR_VALIDATOR"
export PUBLIC_IP="LAPTOP_OR_SERVER_IP/DNS"
export BALANCE_ON_KEY="The amount of tokens allocated at genesis to the key" # For testnets, usually 1000000000
export EMAIL="The email address for validator communications" # Required field, but can be a dummy email (although not recommended)
namada client utils init-genesis-validator \       
    --source $KEY_ALIAS \
    --alias $VALIDATOR_ALIAS \
    --net-address "${PUBLIC_IP}:26656" \
    --commission-rate 0.05 \
    --max-commission-rate-change 0.01 \
    --transfer-from-source-amount $BALANCE_ON_KEY \
    --self-bond-amount 1000000 \
    --email $EMAIL
```

### 2. After generating your keys, the command will print something like this:

#### Before `v0.25.0`

<Callout type="info">
If you have set the variable $XDG_DATA_HOME this is where the pre-genesis TOML will be written to. Otherwise see below for the default locations.
</Callout>

##### Linux 
```text copy
Pre-genesis TOML written to $HOME/.local/share/namada
```

##### MacOS
```text copy
Pre-genesis TOML written to /Users/$USER/Library/Application\ Support/Namada
```

#### After `v0.25.0`

##### Linux 
```text copy
Pre-genesis transactions TOML written to $HOME/.local/share/namada/pre-genesis/$VALIDATOR_ALIAS/transactions.toml
```

##### MacOS
```text copy
Pre-genesis transactions TOML written to /Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Namada/pre-genesis/$VALIDATOR_ALIAS/transactions.toml
```

This file is the public configuration of your validator. You can safely share this file with the network's organizer, who is responsible for setting up and publishing the finalized genesis file and Namada configuration for the chain.

Note that the wallet containing your private keys will also be written into this directory.

### 3. You can print the validator.toml by running: 

#### Before `v0.25.0`
### Linux 
```shell copy
cat $HOME/.local/share/namada/pre-genesis/$VALIDATOR_ALIAS/validator.toml
```

### MacOS 
```shell copy
cat $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Namada/pre-genesis/$VALIDATOR_ALIAS/validator.toml
```

#### After `v0.25.0`
### Linux 
```shell copy
cat $HOME/.local/share/namada/pre-genesis/$VALIDATOR_ALIAS/validator-wallet.toml
```

### MacOS 
```shell copy
cat $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Namada/pre-genesis/$VALIDATOR_ALIAS/validator-wallet.toml
```

## Required keys

- Account key: Can be used to sign transactions that require authorization in the default validator validity predicate, such as a balance transfer.
- Tendermint node key: Can be used to sign transactions on the PoS staking rewards account.
- Protocol key pair: This key is used by the validator's ledger itself to sign protocol transaction on behalf of the validator.
- DKG key: Special key needed for participation in the DKG protocol. (No longer needed after `v0.26.0`)
- Consensus key: Used in CometBFT consensus layer. Currently, this key is written to a file which is read by CometBFT.
- Eth hot key: Used for validating eth-bridge transactions. (No longer after `v0.26.0`)
- Eth cold key: Used for emergency eth-bridge operations.
