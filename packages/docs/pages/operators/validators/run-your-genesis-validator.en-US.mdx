# Run your node as a genesis validator

Once the `CHAIN_ID` has been released, it is possible to join the testnet. If the node joining is registered as a genesis-validator in the genesis file, it will be able to participate in the consensus and produce blocks from the start of the chain. 

#### Joining the network
As a genesis validator, it is then possible to join the network with the `CHAIN_ID` distributed. Let's say this `CHAIN_ID` is `namada-mainnet`.

In this case, the genesis validator can join the network with:

``` bash copy
export CHAIN_ID="namada-mainnet"
namada client utils join-network \
--chain-id $CHAIN_ID --genesis-validator $ALIAS
```

#### Start your node and sync
```bash copy
NAMADA_LOG=info CMT_LOG_LEVEL=p2p:none,pex:error NAMADA_CMT_STDOUT=true namada node ledger run
```
Optional: If you want more logs, you can instead run
```bash copy
NAMADA_LOG=debug CMT_LOG_LEVEL=p2p:none,pex:error NAMADA_CMT_STDOUT=true namada node ledger run
```
And if you want to save your logs to a file, you can instead run:
```bash copy
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s)
NAMADA_LOG=debug CMT_LOG_LEVEL=p2p:none,pex:error NAMADA_CMT_STDOUT=true namada node ledger run &> logs-${TIMESTAMP}.txt
tail -f -n 20 logs-${TIMESTAMP}.txt ## (in another shell)
```
#### If started correctly you should see the following log:
`[<timestamp>] This node is a validator ...`
