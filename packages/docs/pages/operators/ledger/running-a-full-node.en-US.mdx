# Full Node Setup
Before starting a full node, the unique identifier of the `chain-id` wll be needed, which will be released as soon as the genesis file is ready. 

### Join the network
Once the `chain-id` has been distributed, it is possible to join the network with the `CHAIN_ID`:
```bash copy
  export CHAIN_ID="namada-mainnet" ## (replace with the actual chain-id)
  namada client utils join-network --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
  ```

### Start your node and sync
```bash copy
  CMT_LOG_LEVEL=p2p:none,pex:error namada node ledger run
```
Optional: If you want more logs, you can instead run
```bash copy
NAMADA_LOG=info CMT_LOG_LEVEL=p2p:none,pex:error NAMADA_CMT_STDOUT=true namada node ledger run
```
And if you want to save your logs to a file, you can instead run:
```bash copy
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s)
NAMADA_LOG=info CMT_LOG_LEVEL=p2p:none,pex:error NAMADA_CMT_STDOUT=true namada node ledger run &> logs-${TIMESTAMP}.txt
tail -f -n 20 logs-${TIMESTAMP}.txt ## (in another shell)
```

### Running namada as a systemd service
<Callout type="info">
The below script is a community contribution by Encipher88, and currently only works on Ubuntu machines.
It has served useful for many validators.
</Callout>
The below assumes you have installed namada from source, with `make install`. It at least assumes the respective binaries are in `/usr/local/bin/`.

```bash copy
which namada ## (should return /usr/local/bin/namada)
```

The below makes a service file for systemd, which will run namada as a service. This is useful for running a node in the background, and also for auto-restarting the node if it crashes.
```bash copy
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/namadad.service > /dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=namada
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=$USER
WorkingDirectory=$HOME/.local/share/namada
Environment=CMT_LOG_LEVEL=p2p:none,pex:error
Environment=NAMADA_CMT_STDOUT=true
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/namada node ledger run 
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
LimitNOFILE=65535
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```
Enable the service with the below commands:
```bash copy
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable namadad
```
Now you can manage the node through systemd commands:

- Run the node
```bash copy
sudo systemctl start namadad
```
- Stop the node
```bash copy
sudo systemctl stop namadad
```
- Restart the node
```bash copy
sudo systemctl restart namadad
```
- Show node logs
```bash copy
sudo journalctl -u namadad -f -o cat
```
