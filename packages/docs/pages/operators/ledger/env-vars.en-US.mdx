# Environment variables

By default, whenever the namada ledger is started, it will apply the confirguration found in the ledger configuration file.

However, it is possible to override the configuration by setting environment variables.
Any variable found in the config can be accessed through environment variables that are constructed in the below manner.

### Constructing environment variables
Names of the recognized environment variables are derived from the configuration keys by:

1. Prepend `NAMADA_` to the key
2. Uppercase every letter of the key. For example `p2p_pex` becomes `P2P_PEX`
3. Insert a `__` for each nested value. For example, `ledger.cometbft` becomes `LEDGER__COMETBFT`

Hence, the option `p2p_pex` in `[ledger.cometbft]` can be set by
```shell copy
NAMADA_LEDGER__COMETBFT__P2P_PEX=true # or false, depending on your heart's desires
``` 
in the environment 

<Callout type="warning">
**Note**: 
In principle, even `.` can be used for environment variable names. 
However, in Bash, only the double underscore form can be 
used, because Bash doesn't allow dots in environment variable names. 
Therefore, we omit the dot form.
