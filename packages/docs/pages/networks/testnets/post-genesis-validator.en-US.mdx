# Become a validator post genesis

After genesis, you can still join the network as a user and become a validator through self-bonding. 

After [joining the network as a full node](../../operators/ledger/running-a-full-node.mdx), you must [create a validator account](../../operators/validators/post-genesis-validator-setup.mdx).

After this has been completed, you will need to increase your validator's `bonded-stake`, which can be done by self-bonding tokens sourced from the faucet.


## Bonding

Follow [this guide](../../operators/validators/staking.mdx#self-bonding) on how to self-bond a validator's tokens.

## Check bonded-stake
In order to vote on blocks, a validator must have enough `bonded-stake` to be included in the validators "consensus-set". A validator is in the consensus set if and only if it has enough `bonded-stake` to be in the top 128 validators by `bonded-stake`.

To query the bonded-stake for all the validators in the current epoch, run the following command:
```bash copy
namada client bonded-stake
```
