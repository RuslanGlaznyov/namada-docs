# Pre-genesis validator instructions

Pre-genesis is defined as "before" the first (a.k.a genesis) block. 
At genesis, there will be a set of validators with a pre-defined amount of tokens (described in the genesis file).

For testnets, it is possible to apply to become a pre-genesis validator.
In order to do so, please follow [these steps](./genesis-validator-apply.mdx).

If the testnet is already running and you have not been selected as a pre-genesis validator, please follow the steps for [joining as a full node](../../operators/ledger/running-a-full-node.mdx). If you still wish to validate, you can follow the steps to [become a post-genesis-validator](./post-genesis-validator.mdx).
