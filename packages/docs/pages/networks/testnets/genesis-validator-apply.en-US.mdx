# Applying to be a genesis validator

Before a testnet launches, you can apply to be a genesis validator.

### Set up

Follow [this guide](../../operators/validators/genesis-validator-setup.mdx#pre-genesis) on how to generate your "pre-genesis" validator files.

After this, you'll have a `validator.toml` file, the contents of which will look something like the following:

```toml
[validator.1337-validator]
consensus_public_key = "00056fff5232da385d88428ca2bb2012a4d83cdf5c697864dde34b393333a72268"
eth_cold_key = "0103d985a8345ef505cf139c3dfbd5f5a1da73d2864c62ce9d0a98da73898a59f6f9"
eth_hot_key = "010241bb691e44dd3c4263522474e45751e97307e92326250f96c1bcd0a06880875d"
account_public_key = "00f1bd321be2e23b9503653dd50fcd5177ca43a0ade6da60108eaecde0d68abdc8"
protocol_public_key = "0054c213d2f8fe2dd3fc5a41a52fd2839cb49643d960d7f75e993202692c5d8783"
dkg_public_key = "6000000054eafa7320ddebf00c9487e5f7ea5107a8444f042b74caf9ed5679163f854577bf4d0992a8fd301ec4f3438c9934c617a2c71649178e536f7e2a8cdc1f8331139b7fd9b4d36861f0a9915d83f61d7f969219f0eba95bb6fa45595425923d4c0e"
commission_rate = "0.01"
max_commission_rate_change = "0.05"
net_address = "1.2.3.4:26656"
tendermint_node_key = "00e1a8fe1abceb700063ab4558baec680b64247e2fd9891962af552b9e49318d8d"
```

The field `tendermint_node_key` is named this for legacy reasons. It is actually the CometBFT consensus public key.

### Submitting the config
If you want to be a genesis validator for the testnet, please make a pull request to https://github.com/anoma/namada-testnets adding your validator.toml file to the relevant directory (e.g. `namada-public-testnet-2` for the second public testnet), renaming it to `$alias.toml`. 
E.g. if you chose your alias to be "bertha", submit the file with the name `bertha.toml`. You can see what an example PR looks like [here](https://github.com/anoma/namada-testnets/pull/29).

### Wait for the `CHAIN_ID`
Wait until the corresponding `CHAIN_ID` has been distributed.
